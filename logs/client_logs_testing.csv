The overthinking and replaying of conversations can lead to significant distress. It's essential to address this pattern to alleviate symptoms and improve overall functioning. This might involve cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which can help individuals learn to challenge and modify their automatic thoughts and reactions. Additionally, strategies for managing anxiety and reducing rumination, such as mindfulness practices and exposure exercises, can be beneficial.
